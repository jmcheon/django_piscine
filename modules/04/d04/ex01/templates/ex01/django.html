<h1>{{ title }}</h1>
<p>Django is a high-level Python web framework that encourages rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Built by
	experienced developers, it takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app
	without needing to reinvent the wheel. It's free and open source.</p>
<p>Django's history began in the fall of 2003, when Adrian Holovaty and Simon Willison, web programmers at the Lawrence
	Journal-World newspaper, began using Python to build web applications. It was publicly released under a BSD license in
	July 2005.</p>
